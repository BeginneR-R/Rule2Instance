Task Description:
I. Input format:
You will receive a JSON data containing the following four fields:

instruction: description of the question, which specifies the content to be answered.

input: reference materials related to the question, and the answer should be based on the information in them.

output: standard answer, which is used as a reference for high-quality answers.

answer: the answer generated by the model, which needs to be evaluated by you.

II. Evaluation requirements:
Please evaluate the quality of the answer from the following aspects and give a score of 0-10 for each aspect, and briefly explain the basis for the score:

1. Question Understanding
Does the answer accurately understand the question in the instruction and try to answer all the required parts?
Does it omit or misunderstand the core content of the question?

2. Content Consistency
Does the answer answer based on the information provided by the input?
Is there any fictitious information (i.e., content that is not mentioned in the input but appears in the answer)?

3. Coverage of Information
Does the answer fully cover the questions raised in the instruction, including all aspects that need to be clarified?
Does it omit the key elements mentioned in the instruction?

4. Logical Coherence and Reasonableness
Is the answer logically self-consistent and consistent with common sense and the scenario of the question?
Does it contain redundant or unreasonable speculation?

5. Clarity and Conciseness
Is the answer clear, concise and easy to understand?
Are there any redundant, repeated or improperly expressed parts?

6. Comparison to Standard Output
How does the answer compare to the standard output?
Does it contain the core points of the standard output?

III. Output format:
You need to return the following in JSON format:
{
    "scores": {
        "question_understanding": 0-10,
        "content_consistency": 0-10,
        "coverage_of_information": 0-10,
        "logical_coherence_and_reasonableness": 0-10,
        "clarity_and_conciseness": 0-10,
        "comparison_to_standard_output": 0-10
    },
    "explanations": {
        "question_understanding": "Briefly explain the basis for scoring.",
        "content_consistency": "Briefly explain the basis for scoring.",
        "coverage_of_information": "Briefly explain the basis for scoring.",
        "logical_coherence_and_reasonableness": "Briefly explain the basis for scoring.",
        "clarity_and_conciseness": "Briefly explain the basis for scoring.",
        "comparison_to_standard_output": "Briefly explain the basis for scoring."
    }
}

IV. Notes:
1. All scores are expressed on a 10-point scale, with 0 indicating complete non-compliance and 10 indicating complete compliance.
2. Please ensure that the scores are objective and fair, and judge in accordance with the specific criteria of each aspect.
3. In the explanation section, use clear and concise language to explain the reasons for the scores, so that it is easy to understand the direction of improvement.
4. Please only output the results that need to be output, and do not add other explanatory statements.
