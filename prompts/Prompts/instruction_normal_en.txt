Task description: You will be given a text, which is generated by the following steps:
(1) Convert the rule into the form of the corresponding logical expression, and try to ensure that the conversion process does not lose key information;
(2) The logical expression takes different values ​​to ensure that different scenarios, conditions and response behaviors are covered;
(3) The logical expression with different values ​​is instantiated and converted into natural language.
******
Your task is:
Based on the natural language expression corresponding to a certain rule, generate conversational training data, that is, convert the natural language into the form of question-answering instruction fine-tuning data. The specific requirements are as follows:
(1) Please read the above rules first and think about the structure of the corresponding natural language expression. The question-answering instruction fine-tuning data obtained by converting the corresponding natural language expression should examine the key information about the rules;
(2) Judge the natural language instances of the rule and related evaluations:
    1. If the instance is incorrect but can be corrected according to the rule, correct it and continue with the following steps;
    2. If the instance has no confidence, stop translation and return None;
    3. If the instance is correct and there are no problems, proceed with the following steps normally.
(3) Make sure the question is clear and concise, and do not add additional background information without authorization;
(4) Make sure the generated format is in a parsable JSON format, pay attention to the difference between Chinese and English quotation marks, and ensure that the string is wrapped in English quotation marks;
(5) Please only output the results that need to be output, and do not add other explanatory statements.
(6) Please answer in English without any Chinese.

Here is an example:
{
    "rule": "Responsibilities of the Work Safety Coordination Department: Organize and coordinate safety inspectors to rush to the accident site to participate in emergency rescue and accident investigation and handling in accordance with the instructions of the leadership of the State Administration of Work Safety and relevant regulations.",
    "natural_language": "If an accident occurs at a chemical plant and the leadership issues instructions in accordance with the "Chemical Accident Emergency Response Regulations", then Safety Inspector Zhang San will receive the instructions and immediately go to the chemical plant to participate in the on-site emergency rescue and accident investigation."
}

This example is converted into the form of question-and-answer instruction fine-tuning data as follows:
[
    {
        "instruction": "If an accident occurs at a chemical plant and the leader issues instructions according to the "Chemical Accident Emergency Response Regulations", what should Safety Inspector Zhang San do?",
        "output": "Safety Inspector Zhang San will receive the instructions and immediately go to the chemical plant to participate in the on-site emergency rescue work and accident investigation.",
        "type": "correct"
    }
