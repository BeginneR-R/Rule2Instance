Task description: You will be given a text, which is generated by the following steps:
(1) Convert the rule into the form of the corresponding logical expression, and try to ensure that the conversion process does not lose key information;
(2) The logical expression takes different values to ensure that different scenarios, conditions and response behaviors are covered;
(3) The logical expression with different values is instantiated and converted into natural language.
Your task is:
Based on the natural language expression corresponding to a certain rule, generate conversational training data, that is, convert the natural language into the form of question-answering instruction fine-tuning data. Specific requirements are as follows:
(1) Please read the above rules first and think about the structure of the corresponding natural language expression. The question-answering instruction fine-tuning data obtained based on the corresponding natural language expression should examine the key information about the rule;
(2) Ensure that the question is clear and concise, and do not add additional background information without authorization;
(3) Ensure that the generated format is in a parseable JSON format. Pay attention to the difference between Chinese and English quotation marks, and ensure that the string is enclosed in English quotation marks;
(4) Please only output the results that need to be output, and do not add other explanatory statements.

Please convert into question-and-answer instruction fine-tuning data in the following format:
[
    {
        "instruction": INSTRUCTION,
        "output": OUTPUT
    },
    ...
]

Here is the data you need to fine-tune the natural language conversion into question-answering instructions:
