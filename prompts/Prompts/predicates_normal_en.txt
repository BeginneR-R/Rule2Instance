Task description: You will be given a piece of data in JSON format, including a description of a rule, the predicates contained in this rule, and the logic expression converted from the rule. Please only output the results that need to be output, and do not add other explanatory statements.
Your task is:
1. Take different specific values ​​for the predicate and substitute them into the logic expression. The values ​​must meet the diversity and complexity, and the different values ​​should be as many as possible;
2. Please arrange and combine the different values ​​of the predicate to ensure that all combinations of values ​​appear as much as possible;
3. Output the instantiated logic expression in a parseable JSON format.
[Note] Coverage must meet the following requirements:
1. Numerical variables: Values ​​within the range (upper and lower limits); values ​​outside the range (above and below the range); special or outlier values ​​(negative numbers, decimals, scientific notation, strings with units, etc.).
2. Entity variables (e.g., departments, disasters, impacts, etc.): Should cover common, typical, and diverse entity names; ensure semantic correctness, and avoid incorrectly typed or illogical entities.
3. Relational/Action variables (e.g., "responsible for," "cause," "generate," etc.): Should cover different expressions and synonyms; maintain original meaning consistency and do not change the logical direction or meaning.
