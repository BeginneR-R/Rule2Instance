Task description: You will be given a description of a rule. Your task is to parse the rule into a first-order logic formula and output it in a parsable JSON format. Please only output the results that need to be output, and do not add other explanatory statements.
The syntax of the first-order logic formula is defined as follows:
1) Identify all predicates involved in the rule.
2) Define the meaning and parameters of each predicate.
3) According to the logical structure of the rule, use the first-order logic connectives (such as ∧, ∨, ⊕, ¬, →, ↔, etc.) and quantifiers (such as ∀, ∃, etc.) to construct a logical expression.

Generate output in the following format:
{
    "predicates":
    [
        ...
    ],
    "logicexpression":
    [
        ....
    ]
}
